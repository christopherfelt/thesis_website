  ABSTRACT: <br>
  Urbanization and land use change are widespread phenomena and the primary drivers of global ecological change. Researchers from both the social and natural sciences have investigated the effects that land use change has on environmental services and the effectiveness of regulatory bodies in mitigating its harmful impacts. Although there is research on local governmental bodies and their effectiveness in controlling land use change, county governments have often been overlooked. In this article, I study the effectiveness of county governments in controlling land use change using a regression discontinuity design (RDD). The RDD is a quasi-experimental approach that provides stronger support for claims of causality than basic regression analysis. I use the RDD along with multinomial and binary logit estimation to study the capacity of the Ada County government to control land use change in the Treasure Valley, Idaho.

  <h3>UNDERSTANDING LAND USE CHANGE:</h3>
  <br><br>
  There is a substantial amount of research that looks at land use change. Some of this research examines the impact that land use change has on the environment. These impacts include disruptions in ecological function and the discharging of waste in the environment. Other land use change research looks at efforts to mitigate these impacts using regulatory tools by local governments. The tools that are most often used are zoning and adequate facilities provision ordinances. Much of this latter kind of land use change research has looked at the implementation of these regulatory tool within city boundaries. However, it is not always the case that land use change occurs within the jurisdiction of the city.

    <p class = "text_slides">City Limits: 2000 <br>
  Take for example the land use change that occured in the Treasure Valley from 2001-2011. Starting with the image of west Ada County which includes the city Meridian and Eagle. <br>

    <p class = "text_slides">Development: 2001-2006 <br>

  This final image show a few spots where new development occured outside of the city limits. <br>
    </p>

  </div>



    <p>Since we can see that there was a substantial amount of the development outside of the city limits boundaries we need to zoom out and consider the local government body that s responsible for these areas. In this case, that is the county government.</p><br>


    <div id="counties">
      <h1>Counties</h1>
      <!-- <img class="counties" src="counties.png" alt=""><br> -->
    </div>


    <p>The previous research on land use change that have looked at county governments have found that the county government land use regulations have effectively controlled sprawling land use development.</p>

    <p>However, some researchers have found that not all county government are the same. This issue makes it difficult to generalize the results from one county to another. But they exhibit two types of patterns in terms of scope of power. The first pattern consists of strong county governments that share land use change regulation responsibilities with a single large municipal government. The second pattern is a county government that is responsible for the unincorporated areas and then shares responsibilities in certain areas with several different smaller municipalities.</p>

    <p>d.	The previous research has focused on the first pattern of county government. That is, the strong county government that shares regulatory responsibilities with a large municipality. This focus has been at the expense of understanding the second pattern.</p>

    <p>This leads me to my contribution which is that I look at the county government that fits the second pattern and see if it is an effective driver of land use change. Additionally, I use the regression discontinuity design which provides better support for causal claims than basic regression analysis.  I will review the RDD when I discuss my data and methods.</p>

    <p>The area that I look at in my research is the Treasure Valley. And the treasure valley offer an excellent opportunity to study land use change regulation because the two counties, Ada and Canyon, are set up like natural experiment. For instance, since both counties are in the Treasure Valley, they can be expected to share many environmental and geographic qualities. The way in which the two counties differ is in their planning activities. For the period that I am looking, 2001 to 2011, Ada County has been active in developing plans for future development whereas canyon county has been much less active. Therefore, since the two counties share similar environmental and geographic qualities, we potentially can attribute the difference in land use change between the two counties to planning activities. </p>

      Blueprint for Good Growth <br>
      One important set of land use change policies for Ada County is called the Blueprint for Good Growth. The Blueprint is important because it represents a coordinated effort between many different government bodies to develop land use change policy that focuses on Ada County and the cities within it. The Blueprint included policies that were to be specifically implemented by Ada County and the municipal governments.  During this same period, there wasn’t anything similar being developed for Canyon County.
    </p>
    <p class = "blueprint_text_slides">
      Blueprint Development: 2004 - 2006 <br>
      The development of the Blueprint started in 2004. The initial development consisted of incorporating previous planning initiatives from the Ada County Highway District and COMPASS, the local non-profit planning association.
    </p>
    <p class = "blueprint_text_slides">
      Blueprint Development: 2004 - 2006 <br>
      Additionally, the development of the Blueprint incorporated input from several different groups of stakeholders including officials from city governments, the county government, COMPASS as well as developers, large employers and community leaders. These stakeholders made up the steering committee for the Blueprint with voting power reserved for the government officials and representatives from COMPASS. The steering committee also held focus groups and consortiums to get input from the rest of the community.
    </p>
    <p class = "blueprint_text_slides">
      Blueprint Development: 2004 - 2006 <br>
      Towards the end of 2005 and the beginning of 2006 the overarching goals and specific policies were developed. One of the important overarching goals was to reduce sprawling urban development. To achieve this goal, the specific polices that were implemented included restricting development in unincorporated areas of the county and to confine it to designated impact areas which are areas in which public services will be provided in the future.
    </p>
    <p class = "blueprint_text_slides">
      Blueprint Implementation: 2006 - 2007 <br>
      The implementation of the policies was planned to go into immediate effect. The policies were to incorporated into the comprehensive planning guides for each city and the county

    <p class = "blueprint_text_slides">

      However, before 2011, the only governments that incorporated the Blueprint policies were Ada County and Boise.  Both of which did so around mid-2007.

    <h3>Theory and Hypothesis</h3>
    <h4>Optimal timing of development model</h4>
    <p>
      To test the effectiveness of the Ada County government in driving land use change, I follow the recent land use change literature and use the optimal timing of development model. This theory suggests that land owners or developers will change the land use of their parcel if they find that it maximizes their utility. Additionally, land owners will change the land use of their parcels when they find that the cost of waiting outweighs the benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this theory in the context of Ada County, I have two hypotheses that I test. For both hypothesis, I expect that Ada County will have a discernible effect on land use change that fits the Blueprint policies. But for each hypothesis, I assume a different level of enforcement intensity. For the first hypothesis, I assume that Ada County will be a strong enforcer of land use change regulation. What I mean by this is that I assume that Ada County will try to restrict change in land use from undeveloped to developed as much as possible. Specifically, I first hypothesize that if a parcel is in Ada County, then the parcel is less likely to change land use from an undeveloped land use to a developed land use than a parcel in Canyon County.
    </p>

    <h4>H(1): If a parcel is in Ada County then the parcel is less likely to change land use from undeveloped land use to a developed land use than a parcel located Canyon COUNTY
    </h4>

    <p>
      For the second hypothesis, I assume that Ada County will be less strict in enforcing land use change but will still encourage it in impact areas. So, secondly, I hypothesize that if a parcel is in Ada County, then it is more likely to change land use from undeveloped to developed if it is located within a designated city impact area.
    </p>

    <h4>
      H(2): If a parcel is in Ada County, then it is more likely to change land use from undeveloped to a developed land use if it is located within a designated city impact area.
    </h4>

    <p>
      Therefore, the null hypothesis in this case that the Ada County government will not an affect land use change Ada County.
    </p>

    <h4>
      H(0): Ada County government has no effect on land use change
    </h4>

    <p>
      There are six dependent variables that I use to estimate the effect that Ada County has on land use change. The dependent variables were created using NLCD land cover layers for the three years available. The dependent variables are first separated by type. Three of the dependent variables are binary and they capture whether a parcel changes land use from undeveloped to developed. The other three are categorical and capture land use change from undeveloped to a specific developed land use. For instance, a parcel receives a value of 1 if it changed from undeveloped to low intensity development, a 2 if it changed to medium intensity development and a 3 if changed to a high intensity development. A parcel receives a zero if it did not change land use and this is the case for the both the binary and categorical dependent variables. The reason that I use two different discreet dependent variables is because I use two different datasets. The one dataset is based on the RDD which is a smaller subset of the whole dataset. In this dataset the number of occurrence of outcome 2 and 3 are so few that I decided to combine all kinds of development and look at development generally for the parcels included in the RDD dataset. For the whole dataset, I use the categorical dependent variables.

      For each type of dependent variable, there is one that captures a different period. For each type, there is one that captures the period from 2001 to 2011. I use this dependent variable to capture the overall trend of land use change. The second one captures land use change from 2001 – 2006. I use this dependent variable to capture the baseline trends. That is, I look at the associations between the land use change and the drivers of land use change before the Blueprint was implemented. The last period captures change from 2006 – 2011. This is the period in which policies from the Blueprint were implemented. Additionally, this is the period my hypotheses address.

      So each dependent variable is used in a different model. Models one through three use the categorical dependent variables. The first model uses the categorical variable for the period from 01 – 11 and the entire dataset of undeveloped parcels which equal roughly 89 thousand. Moving across we can see the number of occurrences for each outcome with a total 25% percent of the parcels changing land use for the whole period. The next model uses the categorical variable for the period from 01 – 06 and the entire dataset 89 thousand parcel with 24% of the parcels changing land use for this period. The third model uses the categorical variable for the period from 06 – 11 and it uses a dataset that includes parcels that are undeveloped as of 2006 which equals roughly 67 thousand parcels with one percent changing land use. The last three models use the binary dependent variable. Model 4 uses the binary dependent variable for the period from 01 – 11 and uses the dataset based the RDD which I will get into here in a sec. This dataset includes roughly 78 hundred parcels with 19% percent changing land use. Model 5 uses binary dependent variables for 01 – 06. It uses the same number of parcels with 18 percent changing land use for this period. Model 6 uses the binary dependent variable for the period from 06 – 11 and uses parcels from the RDD dataset that are undeveloped as of 2006 with roughly half percent changing land use.

    <p>
      Next are the independent variables and the two primary variables of interest are the county and impact area variables. The county variable is coded to capture the county location of the parcel with a parcel receiving the value of one if it is in Ada County.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impact area variable is coded to capture whether a parcel is in an impact area with 1 if it is. Since impact areas are of interest because of the Blueprint, the impact area variable is included those models that use the dependent variables for 2006 – 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hypothesized outcomes for these variables are as follows. For the first hypothesis, which assumes that Ada County is a strong enforcer of land use regulation, the expected outcome is that the coefficient for the county variable will be negative. This means that Ada County will discourage land use change from undeveloped to developed to such an extent that a parcel located in Ada County is less likely to change land use compared to Canyon County.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second hypothesis, which assumes that Ada County would be a weak enforcer of land use regulation, the expected outcomes are first that the coefficients for the county and impact area variables will be positive and the impact area variable will have a larger coefficient. This means that if a parcel is more likely to develop in Ada County, it is more likely to change land use if it is in an impact area.
